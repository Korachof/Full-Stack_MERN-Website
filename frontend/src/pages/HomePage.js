        <h2>Welcome to my HomePage!</h2>
        
        <h3>The technologies used in this website include HTML, CSS, icons, Express, Google Fonts, JavaScript,
            MongoDB, Mongoose, Node, optimized images, React, REST, and more. 
        </h3>
        <p>
            The website uses HTML to create markup content for each page, to allow the user to read text-content, such as 
            this explanation, as well as other content that you will find in a document. CSS is then used to style such
            content for accessibility and readability, as well as create artful design that is pleasing to the eye. Icons 
            are used to add visual flair and interest to a variety of buttons on the webpage, and are carefully chosen to
            allow for maximum accessibility, as well as to avoid confusion. There is also a favicon icon that is displayed 
            in the browser tab for visual interest. My website also uses the node.js web application framework "Express,"
            which is used for navigation routes and managing the server side of the Node application. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also use Google Fonts for a unique design feel as well as readability and accessibility of written content. There 
            are a variety of fonts, font sizes, and font attributes used throughout the site. Similarly, optimized images are used 
            throughout, both for the background and the image gallery. These images are optimized for contrast, resolution, size, 
            and dimensions to allow for a balance of fast load times and clear images. JavaScript is used to allow for 
            more complex features, such as dynamic tables that allow for user-interactivity, as well as a log page that asks 
            users to create, update, and delete content. MongoDB is used as a database to help manage the files used and created for 
            this log. The Mongoose web server is used to allow for developers, and potentially users, of the site to 
            use their personal machines as web servers to view the content of the page. Similarly, Node allows for the website 
            to use JavaScript code that private machines can run. 
        </p>
        <p>
            React is used to create frontend user interface components, as is used in multiple ways on this website, such as the use and 
            display of icons for buttons. Representational State Transfer, or REST, is used to create consistent performance and 
            scaleability as the website continues to grow over time. It's important to have a high-performing, consist, readable, and
            accessible website that has room to grow in the future. It is also important for the design to be visually appealing without 
            going over the top, and for the content to be user-friendly and easy to understand. A website should, in other words, should 
            improve the lives of users.
